Custom Smart Pointer System with Cycle Handling

Custom C++ smart pointer system (SharedPtr + WeakPtr) with counted references
and support for cycles via weak locking. A minimal implementation that
demonstrates correct resource management, ownership, and hierarchical structures
without memory leaks.
